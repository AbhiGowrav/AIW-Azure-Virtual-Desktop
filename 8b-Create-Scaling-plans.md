# Lab 8b: Create Scaling plans


### Overview

 Azure Virtual Desktop uses Autoscale which let's scale your session virtual machines (VMs) in a host pool up or down to optimize deployment costs. You can create a scaling plan based on:

   - Time of day
   - Specific days of the week
   - Session limits per session host


## Exercise 1: Create a Scaling Plan
